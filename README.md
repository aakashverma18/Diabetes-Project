# Diabetes Prediction Project

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project repository! This project aims to predict diabetes using machine learning techniques on a dataset containing various health metrics. Built with Python, this project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple machine learning models.

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis and prediction of diabetes using supervised machine learning techniques. It includes data cleaning, outlier detection, feature scaling, and handling imbalanced data, followed by training multiple classification models.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `diabetes.csv`, which contains the following features:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (Target: 0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aakashverma18/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following:*
   ```
   numpy
   pandas
   seaborn
   matplotlib
   scikit-learn
   imblearn
   ```

3. Ensure you have the `diabetes.csv` dataset in the root directory.

## Usage
Run the main script to perform the analysis and model training:
```bash
python diabetes_project.py
```

The script will:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Perform EDA (e.g., correlation heatmap, boxplots)
- Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models
- Save the trained Logistic Regression model as `classification_model.pkl`

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values (zeros) with median/mean imputation.
- **EDA**: Includes correlation heatmaps and distribution plots (e.g., BMI).
- **Outlier Detection**: Uses IQR and quantile-based methods to remove outliers.
- **Data Scaling**: Applies `StandardScaler` for normalization.
- **Imbalanced Data Handling**: Uses SMOTE for oversampling.
- **Model Training**: Implements multiple classifiers with performance evaluation.

## Models
The project implements the following machine learning models:
1. **Logistic Regression**: Baseline classification model.
2. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classifier.
3. **Random Forest Classifier**: Ensemble method for improved accuracy.

Model outputs include:
- Predictions
- Accuracy scores
- Confusion matrices
- Classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score)

## Results
- Visualizations (e.g., `correlation-coefficient.jpg`, `boxPlot.jpg`) are saved in the root directory.
- Model performance is printed to the console, with accuracy scores and detailed classification reports.
- The trained Logistic Regression model is saved as `classification_model.pkl` for future use.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
